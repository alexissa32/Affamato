In a large bowl, mix together peanut butter and crushed saltine crackers.

Boil sugar until temperature reaches the \"soft-ball stage\" (238\u00b0F), and don\u2019t take your eyes off it. Timing is everything in confection and you don\u2019t want the syrup to crystallize.

Use a large sheet of wax paper to press the fudge into the dish and ensure even distribution.
