Cut into wedges, squares or circles with a floured kitchen knife and place them 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until the scones are lightly browned. Tip: Scones can be cut into any shape you desire. Use a drinking glass to make circles, or cut into squares or wedges with a knife. Dip the edges of the cutter in flour to prevent the dough from sticking.
