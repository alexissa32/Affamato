into small pieces, place on a plate then into the freezer for 15 minutes, or until butter is very hard.Meanwhile, in a mixer bowl, add the flours and salt. Mix well.In a small ramekin, mix the ice water, vinegar and ice cubes. Set aside.Once the butter is chilled, add half to the flour mixture and cut in either with a pastry cutter, two forks or a paddle attachment. Once the mixture starts to get crumbly, add the remaining butter and keep cutting in until you have flat pieces of butter that are about the size of a pea.Sprinkle the cold vinegar water, 1 tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture. Keep adding the water until the dough comes together and it holds itself when squeezed into a ball. You may need to add a bit more water if dough looks too crumbly. Be careful not to add too much or over mix!Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.Filling: Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F.In a large skillet, add the coconut oil and melt. Add the apple slices, cinnamon and maple and saut for 10 minutes or until semi soft. You don't want them too cooked through as they will cook in the oven. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.While your filling cooks, roll out your dough. It will be slightly tough to roll out since it will be chilled. Using a floured rolling pin, roll your dough out to 12 inch circle. No need to worry about making the edges all pretty. The rustic look is perfect for a galette! Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet.Layer your apples into the middle of the dough, leaving an edge. Fold the edges over the dough, overlapping if needed.Brush with the egg white and sprinkle with the sliced almonds.Place in oven and bake for 48 - 50 minutes or until crust is hard to the touch.Remove from the oven.
